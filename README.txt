Core Programming Tasks:
Below I list where the new tasks for part two were implemented (their file path). I completed all tasks.

1) Search form
    - Added button allowing the user to search based on their location (search.html, css/search.css)
    - Used HTML5 Geolocation API to retrieve the user’s location (js/geolocation.js)

2) Sample results page
    - Embedded a live map into the page using Javascript and LeafletJS, with markers and popup labels. (results_sample.html, js/maps.js, css/results_sample.css)

3) Sample individual object page
    - Embedded a live map into the page showing the individual object's location.(individual_sample.html, js/maps.js, css/individual_sample.css)

4) Object submission page
    - Added client‐side form validation using HTML5/CSS. (submission.html, css/submission.css)
    - Allow the user to set the location of the object using the Geolocation API. (js/geolocation.js)

5) User registration page
    -  Added client‐side form validation using JavaScript (registration.html, js/registration.js, css/registration.css)

Add-on Programming Task:
Only partially completed (didn't animate 10 things).

The things that are animated on the site include:
1) When hovering over a menu item in the navigation bar, a blue horizontal line transitions in and underlines the item (not a static underline). This works for all menu items. These animations can be found in css/style.css.

2) The hamburger menu icon (which appears when the screen is smaller) transforms into an X when the menu is opened. When the X is clicked, the X transforms back into the hamburger menu icon (the three horizontal lines). This animation can be found in css/style.css and in js/hamburger.js.

3) The hamburger menu also flies into view from the left side when it is opened.

Notes to Marker:

I provided specific links to every page on my server. The pages are also accessible by navigating through the site. For instance, through the navigation bar you can access search.html, submission.html and registration.html. results_sample.html can be accessed from the Search page by clicking the search button. Then individual_sample.html can be accessed through the results_sample.html page by clicking the "4. King W. Books" result.
